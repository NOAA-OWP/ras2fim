## Creating a RAS2FIM Conda environment

We recommend that you set up a Anaconda/Python environment for developing `ras2fim` that is separate from the "default" environment that you use in your own work/research.  This will allow you to utilize `ras2fim` without worrying about corrupting the Anaconda/Python environment on which your other work depends.

Below are instructions for building a separate development environment for using the `ras2fim` package using the [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html) package management system.

### Step 1:
Download and Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to your machine.<br>

### Step 2:
Clone a copy of the `ras2fim` repository on to your local machine.<br>

    git clone https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ras2fim.git
