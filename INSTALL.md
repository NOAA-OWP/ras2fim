## Creating a Conda development environment

We recommend that you set up a Anaconda/Python environment for developing `ras2fim` that is separate from the "default" environment that you use in your own work/research.  This will allow you to utilize `ras2fim` without worrying about corrupting the Anaconda/Python environment on which your other work depends.

Below are instructions for building a separate development environment for using the `ras2fim` package using the [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html) package management system which comes bundled with the Anaconda Python distribution provided by Continuum Analytics.
