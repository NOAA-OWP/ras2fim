**Description**:  Starting with geospatially attributed one-dimensional HEC-RAS floodplain models, these scripts are used to create a library of flood depth inundation rasters for a range of storm water discharges (flow).  HEC-RAS models are cut to roughly match the limits of the [National Water Model's {NWM}](https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm) stream designations (hydrofabric).  For each matching NWM stream, a synthetic rating curve is created based on 'reach averaged' flood depths as determined from the HEC-RAS simulations.  The intent it to create a library of flood depth inundation grids with a ccorresponding rating curve that can be paired with the National Water Model's discharges determination and forecasting to create real-time and ppredictive floodplain mapping from a detailed HEC-RAS 1-D model.

  - **Technology stack**: Scripts were all developed in Python 3.8.11.  Use is intended within a custom 'ras2fim' [Anaconda environment](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) running on a Windows OS.  Prior to running these scripts, the user is required to install and run [HEC-RAS v 6.0](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/download.aspx) prior to use.<br><br>
  - **Status**:  Version 1.0 - Inital release.  Refer to to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).<br><br>
  - **Overview Video**: [Link to overview video of ras2fim]()<br><br>
  - **Related Project**:  Inspiration for this repository was to develop flood inundation map libraries to replace Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) as calculated with the [Cahaba](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba) repository where detailed HEC-RAS models exist.
